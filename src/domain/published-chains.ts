/*
 * The one published panels-per-power-cable table this tool could find.
 *
 * Absen, PL V2 Series User Manual, section 4.2, page 19: "Under different cabinet sizes
 * and different input voltages, there are differences in the number of cabinets that
 * wires are able to carry." The table is for ONE 3x2.5mm2 power cable, which is what
 * Absen specify between the distribution box and the cabinet.
 *
 * WHAT THE TABLE TURNS OUT TO BE. The AC110V column is the AC220V column halved and
 * rounded UP — `ceil(at220V / 2)` in all eighteen rows. That is the signature of a
 * CURRENT limit: hold the panel's wattage constant and halve the voltage and you double
 * the current, so you halve the panels. It is not a power limit and not a cable-length
 * limit.
 *
 * Fifteen rows halve exactly. The three that do not are the odd-numbered 7-panel rows
 * (the outdoor 500x1000 Pro cabinets), where 3.5 is rounded up to 4 — and rounding UP is
 * the less conservative direction, so those three 110 V figures sit about 14% higher in
 * current than their own 220 V row does. It is the one place the table argues with
 * itself, and it is worth knowing before leaning on the 110 V column.
 *
 * Divide back out — panels x watts / 220 — and every row lands between about 9.7 A and
 * 15.3 A, i.e. under 16 A, which is what 2.5mm2 flex on a 16 A breaker gives you. So the
 * published figures are a conservative, rounded engineering recommendation that sits
 * inside a 16 A limit, not a computed maximum: Absen have quantised to 7/10/12 panels at
 * 110 V and doubled it. `published-chains.test.ts` asserts exactly that, which is what
 * makes the table worth carrying — it lets the tool show a user how much margin the
 * manufacturer left, rather than just repeating a number at them.
 *
 * Nobody else in the library publishes one. ROE print "Max. Hanging" and "Max. Stacking"
 * instead, which are mechanical and get misread as power limits constantly.
